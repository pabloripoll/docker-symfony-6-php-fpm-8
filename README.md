# Symfony 6 - Service

Container image for Docker

## Alpine 3.19 / Nginx 1.24 / PHP 8.3

- [Symfony 6](https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/setup.html)

- [PHP-FPM 8.3](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3/en.php)

- [Nginx 1.24](https://nginx.org/)

- [Alpine Linux 3.19](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)

Repository: https://github.com/pabloripoll/docker-symfony-php-8.3-service

* Built on the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux distribution
* Multi-platform, supporting AMD4, ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64
* Very small Docker image size (+/-40MB)
* Uses PHP 8.3 for the best performance, low CPU usage & memory footprint
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's `on-demand` process manager)
* The services Nginx, PHP-FPM and supervisord run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs

## Project as Service

The goal of this container image is to provide a start up application with the basic enviroment to deploy a php service running with Nginx and PHP-FPM in a container which follows the best practices and is easy to understand and modify to your needs.

Thus not includes a database neither other services like message broker or mailing, etc.

## Usage on Windows systems

You can use the makefile that comes with this repository or manually update the [./docker/.env](./docker/.env) file to feed the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage on Unix based systems

Makefiles are often used to automate the process of building and compiling software on Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS.

## Reset configurations on the run
In [docker/config/](docker/config/) you'll find the default configuration files for Nginx, PHP and PHP-FPM.

If you want to extend or customize that you can do so by mounting a configuration file in the correct folder;

Nginx configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/nginx-server.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

PHP configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/php-setting.ini:/etc/php83/conf.d/settings.ini" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

PHP-FPM configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/php-fpm-settings.conf:/etc/php83/php-fpm.d/server.conf" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

_Note; Because `-v` requires an absolute path I've added `pwd` in the example to return the absolute path to the current directory_


## Troubleshoots

If you want to connect to another container running your local machine *(for e.g.: database, bucket)* use your ip to do so *(not localhost or 127.0.0.1)*.

Find out your IP on UNIX systems and take the first ip listed
```
$ hostname -I

191.128.1.41 172.17.0.1 172.20.0.1 172.21.0.1
```

Find out your IP on Windows as `administrator user` and take the first ip listed
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>ipconfig /all
